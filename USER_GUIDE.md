### Adding Songs

You can add songs individually via the UI or import multiple songs from text input.

#### Text

Paste or type song titles and optional artist names, one per line, in the format:

```
Title1 - Artist1
Title2 - Artist2
```

If no artist is supplied then just the Title will be stored.

#### Markdown

You can paste or type a Markdown list of songs, one per line, and using a bulleted or numbered list format, for example:

```
Title1 - Artist1
Title2 - Artist2
- Title1 - Artist1
- Title2 - Artist2
1. Title3 - Artist3
2. Title4 - Artist4
```

### Song List View (Responsive Columns)

On wider screens (desktop, tablet landscape, large web) the Song List shows additional columns:

- Key
- Tempo
- Streaming (link icon if a streaming URL is stored)

On compact mobile portrait these extra columns are hidden; key/tempo/link appear condensed on each list item’s trailing side instead.
